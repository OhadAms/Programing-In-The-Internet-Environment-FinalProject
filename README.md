# Programing-In-The-Internet-Environment-FinalProject
Well designed Java Client Server Program where the server handles difficult tasks in a multithreaded environment.

# 🌐 Graph Algorithms & Matrix Analysis System

A high-performance Java system that implements **complex graph algorithms** and a **client–server architecture**.  
This system allows running algorithms on matrices as graphs and querying results via a client connected to a local server.

**Implemented Algorithms:**
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra (Shortest Path)
- Connected Components Detection
- Island / Submarine Counting

## 📝 Project Summary

This project provides a **flexible engine for running graph algorithms on matrices**.  
A matrix is treated as a graph where each cell is a node connected to its valid neighbors.

### What it includes:
- **Graph Algorithms:** DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Connected Components, Island Counting
- **Multithreading:** Algorithms can run in parallel for improved performance
- **Client–Server Architecture:** A server processes algorithm requests from clients
- **Core Structures:** Matrix, Index, Node, TraversableMatrix (defines source/destination + graph rules)

### What it can do:
- Find reachable nodes
- Detect and count isolated regions
- Compute shortest paths
- Run queries via a client-server setup
